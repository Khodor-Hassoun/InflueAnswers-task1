2014-06-03,16,45,jbalnit,"the turtle grammar says there is an optional semi-colon after predicateObjectList. Does this mean you can do: ""s p o ; ."" ?"
2014-06-03,17,36,sesuncedu,"jbalnit:  I've seen that, and had to check to make sure  it wasn't wrong."
2014-06-03,17,38,jbalnit,sesuncedu: gues it makes write out turtle data marginally easier just terminate all p o expressions with ;
2014-06-03,17,38,jbalnit,;)
2014-06-03,17,41,sesuncedu,I'm trying to remember if lists have the same foreberance
2014-06-03,17,42,tobyink,lists are just whitespace separated.
2014-06-03,17,42,tobyink,<#foo> :hasList ( <a> <b> <c> ).
2014-06-03,17,43,jbalnit,"[8]objectList::=object (',' object)*"
2014-06-03,17,46,sesuncedu,vs. [7]    predicateObjectList   ::= http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/PR-turtle-20140109/#grammar-production-verb http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/PR-turtle-20140109/#grammar-production-objectList (';' (http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/PR-turtle-20140109/#grammar-production-verb http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/PR-turtle-20140109/#grammar-production-objectList)?)*
2014-06-03,17,46,sesuncedu,grrr
2014-06-03,17,46,sesuncedu,[7]predicateObjectList::=verb objectList (';' (verb objectList)?)*
2014-06-03,17,50,jbalnit,"hrm, the one i have has a (';')? at the end of it"

2014-06-03,17,51,jbalnit,a little different but still accepts an arbitrary num of semi-colons between/after
2014-06-03,17,53,sesuncedu,"The only major problem I recall with ttl grammar was \"""""""""
2014-06-03,17,53,jbalnit,long string?
2014-06-03,17,54,jbalnit,"'""""""' (('""' | '""""')? ([^""\] | ECHAR | UCHAR))* '""""""'"
2014-06-03,17,55,sesuncedu,There was an error in one of the productions that didn't like escaped double-quote as the last character (it was fixed a good while back).
2014-06-03,17,57,jbalnit,"It can't end in a non-escaped double quote, right?"
2014-06-03,17,59,sesuncedu,There was something that was too greedy - I'm trying to find the fixer
2014-06-03,18,4,jbalnit,"so the [^""\] means *any* utf-8 sequence other than those chars?"
2014-06-03,18,5,jbalnit,does the escaped quote in the long string come out as a non-escaped quote once parsed?
2014-06-03,18,6,sesuncedu,"Once parsed, escapes should be part of the literal"
2014-06-03,18,7,jbalnit,oh
2014-06-03,18,7,sesuncedu,"I mean, the character represented by same"
2014-06-03,18,8,sesuncedu,"so the \""  becomes "" inside the literal"
2014-06-03,18,8,sesuncedu,"The early drafts of turtle allowed for """"""I am a string ending in double-quote """""""", which worked on some parsers and not on others"
2014-06-03,18,10,sesuncedu,unless I have it backwards :)
2014-06-03,18,11,jbalnit,yeah thats painful
2014-06-03,18,11,sesuncedu,The description for STRING_LITERAL_LONG_QUOTE reads: '''
2014-06-03,18,11,sesuncedu,"The characters between the outermost '""""""'s are taken, with numeric and string escape sequences unescaped, to form the unicode string of a lexical form."
2014-06-03,18,11,sesuncedu,''''
2014-06-03,18,12,jbalnit,"right, ok"
2014-06-03,18,13,jbalnit,i wonder why it needs to support escaped quotes
2014-06-03,18,13,jbalnit,"i guess to support triple quotes hehe """"""string inside a string -> """"\""x""""\"""""""""

2014-06-03,18,16,jbalnit,what is the relevance of \u0061?
2014-06-03,18,17,sesuncedu,lowercase letter a
2014-06-03,18,18,jbalnit,"why not just write ""a""?"
2014-06-03,18,18,sesuncedu,"Testing escapes, I think"
2014-06-03,18,19,jbalnit,ahh
2014-06-03,18,20,jbalnit,thanks sesuncedu

2014-06-03,19,50,DanC,hmm... looks familiar; I think I've been using it at home; just not at work
2014-06-03,19,55,sesuncedu,"DanC: aquamacs 3.0a is based on 24 if that explains the pdf - er, deja vu"
2014-06-03,19,55,DanC,sounds like an osx thing. I'm using linux
2014-06-03,19,58,sesuncedu,maybe spelling emacs with a silent x then
2014-06-03,20,10,wu_,"i think Github's editor ""Atom"" is open now, not sure how you are supposed to run Go/sh/JAVA/.. code within it"
2014-06-03,20,13,DanC,harrumph. it looks like emacs doctest mode has bit-rotted (http://ed.loper.org/projects/doctestmode/ )
2014-06-03,20,28,wu_,LDP-testsuite4j Downloading deps 45+ mins now
2014-06-03,20,32,DanC,emacs debugger documentation... leaves something to be desired
2014-06-03,20,33,DanC,exhaustive enumeration where what I need is successive elaboration
2014-06-03,20,33,wu_,imperfect-world assumption proved again?
2014-06-03,20,34,DanC,"ah... I was using the wrong debugger. edebug-defun is more what I expected. (stack overflow to the rescue, once again http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3257480/how-to-debug-elisp )"
2014-06-03,20,34,wu_,getting server X to work with Cimba must be an order of magnitude harder than merely broswwsable in tabuallator
2014-06-03,20,45,jbalnit,"DanC, i think a lot of emacs docs are like that :-p"
2014-06-03,20,45,DanC,I think a lot of docs are like that
2014-06-03,20,45,DanC,never mind emacs
2014-06-03,20,46,DanC,"""oh, you want to use the documentation to learn to do typical things? how quaint"""
2014-06-03,20,47,DanC,"""we expect our users to study our architecture before, well, *using* our software"""
2014-06-03,20,55,sesuncedu,I remember adding clickable hyperlinks to an early fork of emacs that supported x-windows; probably in '88 or '89 .  Didn't help much
2014-06-03,20,55,jbalnit,"DanC, tbh, i think the built-in help system is great for funcs/variables, but when you're trying to figure out a new package or something it's a pain"
2014-06-03,20,56,sesuncedu,epoch! I could not find the name

2014-06-03,21,0,sesuncedu,M-x elisp-index-search
2014-06-03,21,1,sesuncedu,But only useful if you know what you need to know first
2014-06-03,21,2,rszeno,one can use regex appropos
2014-06-03,21,4,sesuncedu,I don't think that searches the docs?
2014-06-03,21,4,sesuncedu,Just the symbols
2014-06-03,21,6,rszeno,"C-h a, then apropos, :) how it look?"
