2014-06-04,14,31,danbri,best for what?
2014-06-04,14,32,olivd,to keep track of references and add qualifiers to triples
2014-06-04,14,33,olivd,"danbri: best for... i don't know, clarity, standards, etc..."
2014-06-04,14,43,danbri,I don't mean to be unhelpful! those kind of qualified property structures are generally painful in rdf

2014-06-04,14,47,TallTed,one good way might be to have a Named Graph comprised of the single Triple --

2014-06-04,14,47,TallTed,with a parallel Named Graph describing it --
